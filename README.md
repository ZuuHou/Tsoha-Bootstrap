## Subject

GreenBook is a helpful tool to manage and track your bets. You can place bets, check your betting history and keep track of your account balance. Find more in the documentation link provided above.

## User Manual

When you open the homepage of the [application](http://jjniitty.users.cs.helsinki.fi/GreenBook/) it will ask you for a username and a password. It is possible to type "devnull" in both fields to log in. An alternative is to create a new user account and log in with it. 
After logging in, you are at the starting page of GreenBook which is still a work in progress. Sadly it will not show your open bets like it is supposed to (sql syntax problem I believe). Pretty much the only option here is to create a new bet.
However, if you go to the [ticket listing](http://jjniitty.users.cs.helsinki.fi/GreenBook/ticket) you will find a listing of tickets. From this page it is possible to modify -> edit/delete existing tickets.
Overall a lot of the needed functions are in place, but the views and linking still need some work.
